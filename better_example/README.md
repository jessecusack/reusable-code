# Better example

Imagine you have received this code and data from someone and are hoping to replicate their analysis.

## Instructions

* Visually inspect the code, list any issues you can see immediately. Are there improvements over the bad example?
* Try and run the code, what works, what doesn't work?
* Finangle with it as much as possible, how much of it can you get to work?
* Seek out and add the missing components, if there are any.
* After having running through the code, are there any final concerns?
