# Why we need to get better at writing software

* We don't write production ready code for millions of users
* But our time and energy is valuable and the more time spend doing real science the better!
* Journals have started requiring that code (and data) be open access

# Pandoc notes 1

Some super quickly created demo slides

* Do not need anything else than markdown
    * Slides title starts with # (also starts a new slide)
    * Bullet points, newlines, empty lines: all standard markdown
* However, can also use other stuff, e.g.:
    * Some HTML (e.g. \<center\>)
    * When using pandoc beamer, can use latex commands (e.g. \\center, \\large, etc)\dots
