# Bad example

Imagine you have received this code and data via email from someone and are hoping to replicate their analysis. They didn't provide much of an explanation for any of it. Can you figure out what is going on?

## Instructions

* Visually inspect the code, list any issues you can see immediately. What do you think it is doing?
* Try and run the code, what works, what doesn't work, what is missing?
* Finangle with it as much as possible, how much of it can you get to work independent of the rest?
* Seek out and add the missing components (using google if necessary, or by installing things using `conda install -c conda-forge [package_name]`)
* Having run the code to the extent possible, is there anything else you'd add to your list of issues?
