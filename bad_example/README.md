# Bad example

Imagine you have received this code and data from someone and are hoping to replicate their analysis.

## Instructions

* Visually inspect the code, list any issues you can see immediately.
* Try and run the code, what works, what doesn't work, what is missing?
* Finangle with it as much as possible, how much of it can you get to work independent of the rest?
* Seek out and add the missing components
* Having run the code to the extent possible, is there anything else you'd add to your list of issues?
