# Good example

Imagine you have received this code and data as a zip file that you extracted into the current directory structure. 

The sender also tells you that "the MATLAB code requires the m_map toolbox (https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html) and the python code requires numpy, scipy, matplotlib and cartopy packages". 

## Instructions

* Look at the folder structure, how is it organised?
* Visually inspect the code, can you spot any issues?
* Try and run the code, what works, what doesn't work, is anything missing?
* Finangle with it as much as possible, how much of it can you get to work independent of the rest?
* Seek out and add the missing components
* Having run the code to the extent possible, is there anything else you'd add to your list of issues?
