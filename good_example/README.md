# Good example

Imagine you have received this code and data as a zip file that you extracted into the current directory structure. 

The sender also tells you that "the MATLAB code requires the m_map toolbox (https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html) and the python code requires numpy, scipy, matplotlib and cartopy packages". 

## Instructions

* Look at the folder structure, how is it organised?
* Visually inspect the code, can you spot any issues? What changed about the MATLAB toolbox? Did anything change with the python utils?
* Try and run the code is anything missing?
* Seek out and add the missing components, if any.
* Having run the code to the extent possible, are there any potential problems you can think of?
